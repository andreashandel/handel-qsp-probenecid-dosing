  abstract = {Most mathematical models used to study the dynamics of influenza A have thus far focused on the between-host population level, with the aim to inform public health decisions regarding issues such as drug and social distancing intervention strategies, antiviral stockpiling or vaccine distribution. Here, we investigate mathematical modeling of influenza infection spread at a different scale; namely that occurring within an individual host or a cell culture. We review the models that have been developed in the last decades and discuss their contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of influenza infections. We review kinetic parameters (e.g., viral clearance rate, lifespan of infected cells) and values obtained through fitting mathematical models, and contrast them with values obtained directly from experiments. We explore the symbiotic role of mathematical models and experimental assays in improving our quantitative understanding of influenza infection dynamics. We also discuss the challenges in developing better, more comprehensive models for the course of influenza infections within a host or cell culture. Finally, we explain the contributions of such modeling efforts to important public health issues, and suggest future modeling studies that can help to address additional questions relevant to public health.},

  abstract = {Influenza viruses still represent a great concern for Public Health by causing yearly seasonal epidemics and occasionally worldwide pandemics. Moreover, spillover events at the animal-human interface are becoming more frequent nowadays, also involving animal species not previously found as reservoirs. To restrict the effects of influenza virus epidemics, especially in at-risk population, and to prepare a drug arsenal for possible future pandemics, researchers worldwide have been working on the development of antiviral strategies since the 80's of the last century. One of the main obstacles is the considerable genomic variability of influenza viruses, which constantly poses the issues of drug-resistance emergence and immune evasion. This review summarizes the approved therapeutics for clinical management of influenza, promising new anti-flu compounds and monoclonal antibodies currently undergoing clinical evaluation, and molecules with efficacy against influenza virus in preclinical studies. Moreover, we discuss some innovative anti-influenza therapeutic approaches such as combination therapies and targeted protein degradation. Given the limited number of drugs approved for influenza treatment, there is a still strong need for novel potent anti-influenza drugs endowed with a high barrier to drug resistance and broad-spectrum activity against influenza viruses of animal origin that may be responsible of future large outbreaks and pandemics.},

However, the usefulness of oseltamivir can be compromised by the emergence and spread of drug-resistant virus. The selective pressure exerted by different oseltamivir therapy regimens have received little attention. Combining models of drug pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, viral kinetics and symptom dynamics, we explored the efficacy of oseltamivir in reducing both symptoms (symptom efficacy) and viral load (virological efficacy). We simulated samples of 1000 subjects using previously estimated between-subject variability in viral and symptom dynamic parameters to describe the observed heterogeneity in a patient population. We simulated random mutations conferring resistance to oseltamivir. We explored the effect of therapy initiation time, dose, intake frequency and therapy duration on influenza infection, illness dynamics, and emergence of viral resistance. Symptom and virological efficacies were strongly associated with therapy initiation time. The proportion of subjects shedding resistant virus was 27-fold higher when prophylaxis was initiated during the incubation period compared with no treatment. It fell to below 1\% when treatment was initiated after symptom onset for twice-a-day intakes. Lower doses and prophylaxis regimens led to lower efficacies and increased risk of resistance emergence. We conclude that prophylaxis initiated during the incubation period is the main factor leading to resistance emergence.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to provide a simple, pharmacokinetic rationale for great similarity in the extent (Fab) of gastrointestinal absorption of about 100 different, diverse compounds between human and the rat in linear dosing range, and to test the general applicability of a novel empirical method to correlate the non-linear Fab between the human and the rat by normalizing doses by body surface area (BSA) or body weight 0.67. METHOD: The mean small intestinal transit time (t) of 36 rats was estimated from the reported study, and this was used to compare with that in humans. The reported great similarity in apparent first-order absorption rate constants (k) of seven structurally diverse compounds between the two species were obtained. Extensive computer search was made and non-linear Fab data for the two species were obtained for chlorothiazide, acyclovir, miglitol and pafenolol. RESULTS: The mean t for rats was estimated to be 3.32 h which is almost identical to that reported in humans. The great similarity in Fab between human and rat in linear absorption range can be rationalized by similar t and k between the two species. The markedly different Fab vs dose/kg of body weight profiles between human and rat for the four drugs showing dose-dependent Fab were found to collapse when doses were normalized by BW0.67. CONCLUSION: For Fab not limited by the solubility problem, the great similarity in Fab between human and rat in linear absorption range can be rationalized by the similar t and k. For non-linear Fab drugs, great similarity in Fab can also be obtained between human and rat when doses are normalized by BSA or BW0.67. Regardless of absorption properties (active, passive or facilitated), similar Fab between the two species may be generally obtained when doses used in humans are about 5 to 7 times lower than that in rats. The above findings may be valuable in drug development.},

  abstract = {The metabolism of probenecid was studied in animals (dogs, monkeys, and rats). The metabolites of probenecid, with one exception, were shown to be terminal metabolites in dogs and rats in vivo and in rats in vitro. One of the alcohol metabolites is further oxidized to the carboxy metabolite. Evidence was obtained that in rats neither ring oxidation of probenecid nor its incorporation into the macromolecular fraction of liver microsomes occurred. The lack of ring oxidation was attributed to the deactivating influence of the ring substituents. These electronic effects (and possibly steric effects) presumably channel metabolism either to the side chain(microsomal oxidation) or to the carboxyl group (conjugation with glucuronic acid). Species differences were observed among the animals studied in the metabolism of probenecid and its piperidyl analog. Probenecid exhibited an unusually short plasma half-life in the monkey. The results with probenecid and its analog suggest that molecular modification of drugs could be oriented in such a way as to prevent ring oxidation, but without loss of pharmacologic activity. The advantage of such a course lies in avoiding formation of epoxide intermediates, which in the case of some drugs, due to their reactivity, might result in toxicity. Acknowledgments. The data from three tests of uricosuric activity of probenecid were provided by Dr. George Fanelli, Jr., Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research. We also acknowledge the able technical assistance of Mr. James P. Tinker, who performed the experiments with monkeys. We thank Dr. B. A. Faraj for assistance in the synthesis of labeled compounds.},

  abstract = {Treatment of seasonal influenza viral infections using antivirals such as neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) has been proven effective if administered within 48 h post-infection. However, there is growing evidence that antiviral treatment of infections with avian-derived strains even as late as 6 days post-infection (dpi) can significantly reduce infection severity and duration. Using a mathematical model of in-host influenza viral infections which can capture the kinetics of both a short-lived, typical, seasonal infection and a severe infection exhibiting sustained viral titer, we explore differences in the effects of NAI treatment on both types of influenza viral infections. Comparison of our model's behavior against experimental data from patients naturally infected with avian strains yields estimates for the times at which patients were infected that are consistent with those reported by the patients, and estimates of drug efficacies that are lower for patients who died than for those who recovered. In addition, our model suggests that the sustained, high, viral titers often seen in more severe influenza virus infections are the reason why antiviral treatment delayed by as much as 6 dpi will still lead to reduced viral titers and shortened illness. We conclude that NAIs may be an effective and beneficial treatment strategy against more severe strains of influenza virus characterized by high, sustained, viral titers. We believe that our mathematical model will be an effective tool in guiding treatment of severe influenza viral infections with antivirals.},

By use of open-flow microperfusion, four macroscopically perforated double lumen catheters were inserted into the tissue regions of interest and constantly perfused. Across the macroscopic perforations of the catheters interstitial fluid was partially recovered in the perfusion fluid. Catheters were perfused with five solutions, each containing different concentrations of albumin. Absolute interstitial albumin concentrations were calculated by applying linear regression analysis to perfusate vs. sampled albumin concentration (no-net-flux calibration technique). Interstitial albumin concentrations were significantly lower (P {$<$} 0.0001) in adipose tissue (7.36 g/l; r = 0.99, P {$<$} 0.0003; range: 4.3-10.7 g/l) and in skeletal muscle (13.25 g/l; r = 0.99, P {$<$} 0.0012; range: 9.7 to 15.7 g/l) compared with the serum concentration (48.9 +/- 0.7 g/l, mean +/- SE, n = 6; range: 46.4-50.4 g/l). Furthermore, interstitial albumin concentrations were significantly higher in skeletal muscle compared with adipose tissue (P {$<$} 0.01). The study indicates that open-flow microperfusion allows stable sampling of macromolecules from the interstitial space of peripheral tissue compartments. Moreover, the present data report for the first time in healthy humans in vivo the true albumin concentrations of interstitial fluid of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.},

  abstract = {Background---Transgenic mice expressing tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}) in cardiac myocytes develop dilated cardiomyopathy, but the temporal progression to cardiac dysfunction is not well characterized. We asked (1) Does magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide a reproducible assessment of cardiac output in mice that correlates with invasive measurements obtained with thermodilution? (2) What is the time course of left ventricular (LV) remodeling in transgenic mice with myocardial expression of TNF-{$\alpha$}? Methods and Results---Transgenic mice from 2 different lineages with differing amounts of myocardial TNF-{$\alpha$} expression [lineage 1 (L1) and lineage 2 (L2)] and littermate controls (LC) were studied. In protocol 1, cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were measured by MRI and thermodilution (TD) in 15 mice (3 L1, 4 L2, 8 LC). In protocol 2, 23 mice (7 L1, 8 L2, 8 LC) were scanned at 1 month of life and every 4 weeks thereafter. In both protocols, cine-MRI was performed with the use of a 1.5-T clinical system (1.5-mm slices, 195{\texttimes}195 {$\mu$}m in-plane resolution). MRI CO and SV correlated well with TD [COTD (mL/min)=0.94*COMRI+0.72, r=0.84; SVTD({$\mu$}L)=1.01*SVMRI-1.07, r=0.94]. Serial MRI studies showed significant increase in LV mass and volumes over time and a significant decrease in ejection fraction in transgenic mice when compared with littermate controls. Compared with lineage 2, lineage 1 showed significantly larger LV mass and volumes and significantly lower ejection fraction. Conclusions---MRI assessment of cardiac function in mice correlates well with invasive measurements. Serial MRI studies in the TNF-{$\alpha$} mouse model demonstrate that the rate of progression and severity of LV dysfunction are dependent on the degree of TNF-{$\alpha$} overexpression.},

Reporting data on animal age, animal body weight, and animal postnatal developmental stages is not consistent, which can cause the failure to translate animal data to humans. This review summarizes age-related postnatal developmental stages in rats by addressing age-related changes in their body weights. The age and body weight of animals can affect drug metabolism, gene expression, metabolic parameters, and other dependent variables measured in animal studies. In addition, considering the age and the body weight of the animals is of particular importance in animal modeling of human diseases. Appropriate reporting of age, body weight, and the developmental stage of animals used in studies can improve animal to human translation.},

  abstract = {The Hill equation was first introduced by A.V. Hill to describe the equilibrium relationship between oxygen tension and the saturation of haemoglobin. In pharmacology, the Hill equation has been extensively used to analyse quantitative drug-receptor relationships. Many pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models have used the Hill equation to describe nonlinear drug dose-response relationships. Although the Hill equation is widely used, its many properties are not all well known. This article aims at reviewing the various properties of the Hill equation. The descriptive aspects of the Hill equation, in particular mathematical and graphical properties, are examined, and related to Hill's original work. The mechanistic aspect of the Hill equation, involving a strong connection with the Guldberg and Waage law of mass action, is also described. Finally, a probabilistic view of the Hill equation is examined. Here, we provide some new calculation results, such as Fisher information and Shannon entropy, and we introduce multivariate probabilistic Hill equations. The main features and potential applications of this probabilistic approach are also discussed. Thus, within the same formalism, the Hill equation has many different properties which can be of great interest for those interested in mathematical modelling in pharmacology and biosciences.},

  abstract = {Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.},

Clinical measures were the frequency of febrile illness and symptom severity scores.Results.---Intranasal GG167 was well tolerated for both prophylaxis and therapy. For all dose groups combined, GG167 prophylaxis was 82\% effective in preventing laboratory evidence of infection and 95\% effective in preventing febrile illness (P\&lt;.01 vs placebo). Early treatment with GG167 reduced peak viral titers by 2.0 log10, the median duration of viral shedding by 3 days, and the frequency of febrile illness by 85\% (P\&lt;.05 for each comparison). Other measures of illness were reduced by approximately 50\% to 70\% in the GG167 dosing groups. Twice daily dosing was as effective as six times daily.Conclusions.---Direct respiratory administration of the selective neuraminidase inhibitor GG167 appears safe and effective for both prevention and early treatment of experimental influenza. Influenza virus neuraminidase is important for viral replication in humans.(JAMA. 1996;275:295-299)},

  abstract = {Oseltamivir is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase, which is approved for use for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B virus infections. In the event of an influenza pandemic, oseltamivir supplies may be limited; thus, alternative dosing strategies for oseltamivir prophylaxis should be explored. Healthy volunteers were randomized to a three-arm, open-label study and given 75 mg oral oseltamivir every 24 h (group 1), 75 mg oseltamivir every 48 h (q48h) combined with 500 mg probenecid four times a day (group 2), or 75 mg oseltamivir q48h combined with 500 mg probenecid twice a day (group 3) for 15 days. Pharmacokinetic data, obtained by noncompartmental methods, and safety data are reported. Forty-eight subjects completed the pharmacokinetic analysis. The study drugs were generally well tolerated, except for one case of reversible grade 4 thrombocytopenia in a subject in group 2. The calculated 90\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratios between groups 2 and 3 and group 1 were outside the bioequivalence criteria boundary (0.80 to 1.25) at 0.63 to 0.89 for group 2 versus group 1 and 0.57 to 0.90 for group 3 versus group 1. The steady-state apparent oral clearance of oseltamivir carboxylate was significantly less in groups 2 (7.4 liters/h; 90\% CI, 6.08 to 8.71) and 3 (7.19 liters/h; 90\% CI, 6.41 to 7.98) than in group 1 (9.75 liters/h; 90\% CI, 6.91 to 12.60) (P {$<$} 0.05 for both comparisons by analysis of variance). The (arithmetic) mean concentration at 48 h for group 2 was not significantly different from the mean concentration at 24 h for group 1 (42 {\textpm} 76 and 81 {\textpm} 54 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.194), but the mean concentration at 48 h for group 3 was significantly less than the mean concentration at 24 h for group 1 (23 {\textpm} 26 and 81 {\textpm} 54 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.012). Alternate-day dosing of oseltamivir plus dosing with probenecid four times daily achieved trough oseltamivir carboxylate concentrations adequate for neuraminidase inhibition in vitro, and this combination should be studied further.},

This study describes a global analysis of the susceptibility of influenza viruses to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs, oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, laninamivir) and the cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor (CENI, baloxavir) for three periods (May to May for 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023). In particular, global influenza activity declined significantly in 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 when compared to the pre-pandemic period of COVID-19. Combined phenotypic and NA sequence-based analysis revealed that the global frequency of seasonal influenza viruses with reduced or highly reduced inhibition (RI/HRI) by NAIs remained low, 0.09\% (2/2224), 0.12\% (27/23465) and 0.23\% (124/53917) for 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, respectively. As in previous years, NA-H275Y in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses was the most frequent substitution causing HRI by oseltamivir and peramivir. Sequence-based analysis of polymerase acidic (PA) protein supplemented with phenotypic testing revealed low global frequencies of seasonal influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility (RS) to baloxavir, 0.07\% (1/1376), 0.05\% (9/18380) and 0.12\% (48/39945) for 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, respectively; commonly associated substitutions were PA-I38T/M/L. In Japan, the rate was 3.3\% (16/488) during 2022-2023, with 11 A(H3N2) viruses having PA-I38T/M substitutions. For zoonotic viruses, 2.7\% (3/111) contained substitutions, one each NA-H275Y, NA-S247N and NA-N295S, associated with RI/HRI NAI phenotypes, and none contained PA substitutions associated with RS to baloxavir. In conclusion, the great majority of seasonal and zoonotic influenza viruses remained susceptible to NAIs and CENI baloxavir.},

  abstract = {1. Methods of interspecies extrapolation using physiological models and allometric scaling have been reviewed with their possible application to drug development, both for candidate drug selection and the interpretation of toxicokinetic data. 2. Physiological models offer a mechanistic approach to extrapolation from one species to another, examining individual components which interrelate to produce the characteristics of the whole system. Tissues of interest are arranged in anatomical order based on blood circulation, and the disposition of a drug can be simulated with knowledge of tissue size (volume), tissue perfusion (blood flow), drug permeability, binding of the drug between the tissue and blood (partition), as well as elimination. Using this approach the behaviour of the drug under different conditions, such as dose route, disease state or animal species, can be predicted. 3. The alternative approach of allometric scaling is an empirical examination of relationships between size, time and its consequences. A regression of the logarithm of the pharmacokinetic parameter and the logarithm of the body weight of the animal species produces a linear relationship which enables the value of pharmacokinetic parameters in any animal species to be calculated from the product of an allometric coefficient and the body weight to a power function. 4. Whilst this technique gives acceptable predictions for the pharmacokinetics of those drugs eliminated renally, or which are blood flow-dependent, there is poor prediction for humans for low clearance drugs primarily eliminated by the mixed-function oxidase system. This appears to be a result of differences in maturation, and can be corrected for by including a brain weight or maximum life-span potential term into the allometric equation. 5. Of the two approaches described for extrapolation of pharmacokinetics between animal species, physiological models tend to be resource-demanding and costly, with more frequent failures, but can be invaluable for examining target organ exposure and for the targeting of drugs as in cancer chemotherapy. For routine drug development, however, allometric scaling is potentially more useful since it uses data which are routinely obtained and the calculations are relatively simple. 6. The problems of intraspecies scaling from high-dose data to low-dose predictions are discussed with respect to current models of dose levels. A new approach is proposed using a modified Hill equation based on drug exposure, which should allow for a more meaningful determination of the toxicity of a compound with different drug exposures. 7. The problems and errors of interspecies scaling on a dose weight per body weight are demonstrated and alternative approaches based on allometric scaling are proposed.},

Because of compromises made between precision and noninvasiveness, data obtained may have an uncertain bearing on the mechanical response of the lung. Nevertheless, considerable recent progress has been made in developing valid and useful measures of mouse lung function. These advances, resulting in our current ability to measure sophisticated indices of lung function in laboratory animals, are likely to lead to important insights into the mechanisms of lung disease.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary circulation includes a~vast network of arteries, veins, and lymphatics that function to exchange blood and other tissue fluids between the heart, the lungs, and back. They are designed to perform certain specific functions that are~unique to the pulmonary circulation, such as~ventilation and gas exchange. The pulmonary circulation receives the entirety~of the cardiac output from the right heart and is a low pressure, low resistance system due to its parallel capillary circulation. The system can be~divided into the following components: The arterial circuit arises from~the main pulmonary artery arising from the right ventricle and runs a course of only 5 cm before dividing~into right and left main branches and many subsequent branches to form an extensive network of small arteries, arterioles, and~capillaries. The pulmonary arteries are thinner (one-third the thickness of their counterpart systemic vessels) and have a larger diameter. The combined effect makes them much more distensible and compliant (approximately 7mL/mmHg). The~venous circuit~begins with the venules that drain the capillaries. They join to form smaller veins and eventually merge to form the main~pulmonary veins draining into the left atrium. Like the arteries, the pulmonary veins are thinner and more distensible than the counterpart systemic veins and accommodate more blood because of their larger compliance. Lymphatics~play a crucial role in maintaining a dry alveolar membrane and preventing accumulation of tissue fluid around the pulmonary circulation. They can be found~close to the terminal bronchioles and drain the mediastinal lymphatics before emptying into~the right lymphatic duct. It is appropriate to mention that a similar system of lymphatics and vessels exists between the parietal and visceral pleurae, draining the pleural fluid which plays an important role in providing a viscous medium for expansion of lungs during their respiratory excursion. The large negative pleural pressure (approximately -4 to -7 mmHg) exists because of an efficient efferent venous and lymphatic system that keeps the alveoli closely tethered to the visceral pleura and prevents them from collapsing inwards. In addition to the pulmonary circulation, the lung parenchyma receives oxygenated blood via the bronchial circulation~(accounting for about {\textasciitilde}1\% of the cardiac output) which arises~from the aorta, and thus left ventricle. The bronchial circulation has superifical and deep systems. The superficial system drains into the hemiazygos and azygos veins, which ultimately drain into the right heart with the systemic venous return. However, the deep circulation drains into the pulmonary vein and thus left ventricle. As a result, the deep~bronchial system effectively functions as an arteriovenous shunt. However, its venous return to the left heart is minimal (0-0.5\% of cardiac output) and does not affect cardiac output to any significant degree as volumes between right and left ventricles are nearly identicle.},

With the use of gas anesthesia, mice {$>$}30 g body wt were instrumented either with transit-time flow probes or electromagnetic probes placed on the ascending aorta. Ascending aortic flow values were recorded 6-16 days after surgery when probes had fully grown in. In the first set of experiments, while mice were under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, estimates of stroke volume (SV) obtained by the transit-time technique were compared with those simultaneously obtained by echocardiography. Transit-time values of SV were similar to those obtained by echocardiography. The average difference +/- SD between the methods was 2 +/- 7 microl. In the second set of studies, transit-time values of CO were compared with those obtained by the electromagnetic flow probes. In conscious resting conditions, estimates +/- SD) of cardiac index (CI) obtained by the transit-time and electromagnetic flow probes were 484 +/- 119 and 531 +/- 103 ml x min(-1) x kg body wt(-1), respectively. Transit-time flow probes were also implanted in mice with a myocardial infarction (MI) induced by ligation of a coronary artery 3 wk before probe implantation. In these MI mice (n = 7), average (+/- SD) resting and stimulated (by volume loading) values of CO were significantly lower than in noninfarcted mice (n = 15) (resting CO 16 +/- 3 vs. 20 +/- 4 ml/min; stimulated CO 20 +/- 5 vs. 26 +/- 6 ml/min). Finally, using transfer function analysis, we found that, in resting conditions for both intact and MI mice, spontaneous variations in CO ({$>$} 0.1 Hz) were mainly due to those occurring in SV rather than in heart rate. These data indicate that CO can be measured chronically and reliably in conscious mice, also in conditions of heart failure, and that variations in preload are an important determinant of CO in this species.},

Background: We have previously shown that probenecid inhibits RSV, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro in preclinical animal models and in humans. In a Phase two randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, dose range-finding study using probenecid to treat non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19, we previously showed that a 1000 mg twice daily treatment for 5 days reduced the median time to viral clearance from 11 to 7 days, and a 500 mg twice daily treatment for 5 days reduced the time to viral clearance from 11 to 9 days more than the placebo. Methods: In this study, we sought to determine the mechanism of action of the probenecid inhibition of RSV replication in human respiratory epithelial (A549) cells. Results: We show that probenecid inhibits the RSV-induced phosphorylation of JNKs and ERKs and the downstream phosphorylation of c-jun, a component of the AP-1 transcription complex needed for virus replication. The inhibition of JNKs by probenecid reversed the repression of transcription factor HNF-4. Conclusion: The probenecid inhibition of JNK and ERK phosphorylation involves the MAPK pathway that precludes virus replication.},

Viruses exploit host cell machinery for replication, which engages the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. The MAPK signaling pathways are triggered by pattern recognition receptors that recognize the pathogen, infection, or external stimuli, leading to the induction and regulation of immunity and inflammation. Probenecid, used to improve renal function by inhibiting the tubular reabsorption of uric acid, has been shown to have therapeutic efficacy in reducing inflammation and blocking viral replication by inhibiting components of the MAPK pathway that preclude virus replication.

  abstract = {A population drug-disease model was developed to describe the time course of influenza virus with and without oseltamivir treatment and to investigate opportunities for antiviral combination therapy. Data included viral titers from 208 subjects, across 4 studies, receiving placebo and oseltamivir at 20 to 200 mg twice daily for 5 days. A 3-compartment mathematical model, comprising target cells infected at rate {$\beta$}, free virus produced at rate p and cleared at rate c, and infected cells cleared at rate {$\delta$}, was implemented in NONMEM with an inhibitory Hill function on virus production (p), accounting for the oseltamivir effect. In congruence with clinical data, the model predicts that the standard 75-mg regimen initiated 2 days after infection decreased viral shedding duration by 1.5 days versus placebo; the 150-mg regimen decreased shedding by an additional average 0.25 day. The model also predicts that initiation of oseltamivir sooner postinfection, specifically at day 0.5 or 1, results in proportionally greater decreases in viral shedding duration of 5 and 3.5 days, respectively. Furthermore, the model suggests that combining oseltamivir (acting to subdue virus production rate) with an antiviral whose activity decreases viral infectivity ({$\beta$}) results in a moderate additive effect dependent on therapy initiation time. In contrast, the combination of oseltamivir with an antiviral whose activity increases viral clearance (c) shows significant additive effects independent of therapy initiation time. The utility of the model for investigating the pharmacodynamic effects of novel antivirals alone or in combination on emergent influenza virus strains warrants further investigation.},

  abstract = {This methodical work describes the measurement and calculation of pulmonary blood volume in mice based on two imaging techniques namely by using magnetic particle imaging (MPI) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Besides its feasibility aspects that may influence quantitative analysis are studied. Eight FVB mice underwent cardiac MRI to determine stroke volumes and anatomic MRI as morphological reference for functional MPI data. Arrival time analyses of boli of 1~{\textmu}l of 1~M superparamagnetic tracer were performed by MPI. Pulmonary transit time of the bolus was determined by measurements in the right and left ventricles. Pulmonary blood volume was calculated out of stroke volume, pulmonary transit time and RR-interval length including a maximal error analysis. Cardiac stroke volume was 31.7~{\textmu}l\,{\textpm}\,2.3~{\textmu}l with an ejection fraction of 71\%\,{\textpm}\,6\%. A sharp contrast bolus profile was observed by MPI allowing subdividing the first pass into three distinct phases: tracer arrival in the right ventricle, pulmonary vasculature, and left ventricle. The bolus full width at half maximum was 578~ms\,{\textpm}\,144~ms in the right ventricle and 1042~ms\,{\textpm}\,150~ms in the left ventricle. Analysis of pulmonary transit time revealed 745~ms\,{\textpm}\,81~ms. Mean RR-interval length was 133~ms\,{\textpm}\,12~ms. Pulmonary blood volume resulted in 177~{\textmu}l\,{\textpm}\,27~{\textmu}l with a mean maximal error limit of 27~{\textmu}l. Non-invasive assessment of the pulmonary blood volume in mice was feasible. This technique can be of specific value for evaluation of pulmonary hemodynamics in mouse models of cardiac dysfunction or pulmonary disease. Pulmonary blood volume can complement cardiac functional parameters as a further hemodynamic parameter.},

  abstract = {The major function of the lung is gas exchange and depends on alveolar and capillary parameters such as surface area and volume. The number of alveoli may report on the nature of structural changes in lung parenchyma during development, illness or changing environmental factors. We therefore developed an efficient and easily applicable stereological design for estimating and monitoring these structural parameters in the mouse lung. The estimation of volume fractions of different lung compartments has been carried out by point counting. A combination of cycloid grids superimposed on vertical sections was used to estimate the capillary surface area with isotropic test lines. Capillary length could be measured using the harmonic mean of the surface weighted diameter. The Euler characteristic applied in the physical fractionator with varying but known sampling fractions (Horovitz-Thompson estimator) enabled us to estimate alveolar number. In adult mice lungs, we obtained total values for alveolar number of 2.31 {\texttimes} 106 alveoli in a pair of lungs, alveolar surface area of 82.2 cm2, capillary surface area of 124 cm2, and capillary length of 1.13 km. All values are corrected for tissue shrinkage. With this study we present a highly efficient combination of several design-based stereological tools for the unbiased estimation of alveolar number and volume as well as length, surface area, and diameter of capillaries in the mice lung.

The interaction between gemifloxacin and probenecid has not yet been studied. We studied the extent, time course, site(s), and mechanism of this interaction. Seventeen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, two-way crossover study. Subjects received 320 mg gemifloxacin as an oral tablet without and with 4.5 g probenecid divided in eight oral doses. Drug concentrations in plasma and urine were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. WinNonlin was used for noncompartmental analysis, compartmental modeling, and statistics, and NONMEM was used for visual predictive checks. Concomitant administration of probenecid increased plasma gemifloxacin concentrations and amounts excreted in urine compared to baseline amounts. Data are average estimates (percent coefficients of variation). Modeling showed a competitive inhibition of the renal tubular secretion of gemifloxacin by probenecid as the most likely mechanism of the interaction. The estimated Km and Vmax for the saturable part of renal elimination were 9.16 mg/liter (20\%) and 113 mg/h (21\%), respectively. Based on the molar ratio, the affinity for the renal transporter was 10-fold higher for gemifloxacin than for probenecid. Since probenecid reached an {$\sim$}200-times-higher area under the molar concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h than gemifloxacin, probenecid inhibited the active tubular secretion of gemifloxacin. Probenecid also reduced the nonrenal clearance of gemifloxacin from 25.2 (26\%) to 21.0 (23\%) liters/h. Probenecid inhibited the renal tubular secretion of gemifloxacin, most likely by a competitive mechanism, and slightly decreased nonrenal clearance of gemifloxacin.},

AIMS Probenecid influences transport processes of drugs at several sites in the body and decreases elimination of several quinolones. We sought to explore extent, time course, and mechanism of the interaction between ciprofloxacin and probenecid at renal and nonrenal sites. METHODS A randomized, two-way crossover study was conducted in 12 healthy volunteers (in part previously published Clin Pharmacol Ther 1995; 58: 532--41). Subjects received 200 mg ciprofloxacin as 30-min intravenous infusion without and with 3 g probenecid divided into five oral doses. Drug concentrations were analysed by liquid chromatography--tandem mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. Ciprofloxacin and its 2-aminoethylamino-metabolite (M1) in plasma and urine with and without probenecid were modelled simultaneously with WinNonlin{\textregistered}. RESULTS Data are ratio of geometric means (90\% confidence intervals). Addition of probenecid reduced the median renal clearance from 23.8 to 8.25 l h-1[65\% reduction (59, 71), P {$<$} 0.01] for ciprofloxacin and from 20.5 to 8.26 l h-1 (66\% reduction (57, 73), P {$<$} 0.01] for M1 (estimated by modelling). Probenecid reduced ciprofloxacin nonrenal clearance by 8\% (1, 14) (P {$<$} 0.08). Pharmacokinetic modelling indicated competitive inhibition of the renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and M1 by probenecid. The affinity for the renal transporter was 4.4 times higher for ciprofloxacin and 3.6 times higher for M1 than for probenecid, based on the molar ratio. Probenecid did not affect volume of distribution of ciprofloxacin or M1, nonrenal clearance or intercompartmental clearance of ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS Probenecid inhibited the renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and M1, probably by a competitive mechanism and due to reaching {$>$}100-fold higher plasma concentrations. Formation of M1, nonrenal clearance and distribution of ciprofloxacin were not affected.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Adults aged 18-64~years comprise most of the working population, meaning that influenza infection can be disruptive, causing prolonged absence from the workplace, and reduced productivity and the ability to care for dependents. Influenza vaccine uptake is relatively low, even among the older adults in this population (i.e., aged 50-64~years), reflecting a lack of perceived need for vaccination. This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to characterize the global burden of influenza in the 18-64~years population. METHODS: An electronic database search was conducted and supplemented with conference and gray literature searches. Eligible studies described at least one of clinical, humanistic, or economic outcomes in adults aged 18-64~years and conducted across several global regions. Included studies were published in English, between January 1, 2012, and September 20, 2022. RESULTS: A total of 40 publications were included, with clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes reported in 39, 5, and 15, respectively. Risk of influenza-associated clinical outcomes were reported to increase with age among the 18-64~years population, including hospitalizations (Yamana et al. in Intern Med 60:3401-3408, 2021; Derqui et al. in Influenza Other Respir Viruses 16:862-872, 2022; Fuller et al. in Influenza Other Respir Viruses 16:265-275, 2022; Ortiz et al. in Crit Care Med 42:2325-2332, 2014; Yandrapalli et al. in Ann Transl Med 6:318, 2018; Zimmerman et al. in Influenza Other Respir Viruses 16:1133-1140, 2022). ICU admissions, mortality, ER/outpatient visits, and use of mechanical ventilation were recorded. Adults aged 18-64~years with underlying comorbidities were at higher risk of influenza-related hospitalizations, ICU admission, and mortality than otherwise healthy individuals. Length of hospital stay increased with age, although a lack of stratification across other economic outcomes prevented identification of further trends across age groups. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of hospitalization and outpatient visits demonstrated a clinical influenza-associated burden on patients and healthcare systems, which is exacerbated by comorbidities. Considering the size and breadth of the general population aged 18-64~years, the limited humanistic and economic findings of this SLR likely reflect an underreported burden. Greater investigation into indirect costs and prolonged absenteeism associated with influenza infection is required to fully understand the economic burden in this population.},

  abstract = {Probenecid is an orally bioavailable, uricosuric agent that was first approved in 1951 for the treatment of gout, but was later found to have potent, broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a phase 2 randomized, placebocontrolled, single-blind, dose-range finding study in non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either 500 mg of probenecid, 1000 mg of probenecid, or a matching placebo every 12 h for five days. The patients' COVID-19 viral load hospitalization, or death from any cause through day 28, as well as safety, were evaluated. COVID-19-related symptoms were assessed at baseline, and on days 3, 5, 10, 15, and 28. The primary endpoints of the study were time to first negative SARS-CoV-2 viral test (or viral clearance) and the proportion of patients that were symptom-free at day 5. A total of 75 patients were randomized, with 25 patients in each group. All of the patients completed the study as planned with no hospitalizations or deaths being reported. The median time to viral clearance was significantly shorter for the probenecid 1000 mg group than for placebo (7 days vs. 11 days, respectively; p {$<$} 0.0001), and for the probenecid 500 mg group versus placebo (9 days vs. 11 days, respectively; p {$<$} 0.0001). In addition, the median time to viral clearance was significantly shorter for the probenecid 1000 mg group than for the probenecid 500 mg group (7 days vs. 9 days, respectively; p {$<$} 0.0001). All patients reported at least one COVID-19-related symptom on days 3 and 5; however, on day 10, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving probenecid 1000 mg reported the complete resolution of symptoms versus placebo (68\% vs. 20\%, respectively; p = 0.0006), as well as for those receiving probenecid 500 mg versus placebo (56\% vs. 20\%, respectively, p = 0.0087). The incidence of adverse events during treatment was similar across all groups for any adverse event, and was 12\%. All events were mild with no serious adverse events reported and no discontinuations due to an adverse event. The treatment of patients with symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with probenecid resulted in a significant, dose-dependent decrease in the time to viral clearance and a significantly higher proportion of patients reporting complete symptom resolution by day 10.

  abstract = {Land mammals range in size from the 3-g shrew to the 3000-kg elephant. Despite this 106 range in weight, most land mammals have similar anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and cellular structure. This similarity has allowed interspecies scaling of physiologic properties such as heart rate, blood flow, blood volume, organ size, and longevity. The equation that is the basis for scaling physiologic properties among mammals is the power equation Y = aWb, where Y is the physiologic variable of interest, W is body weight, and log a is the y-intercept and b is the slope obtained from the plot of log Y versus log W. Animals commonly used in preclinical drug studies (i.e., mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys, and dogs) do not eliminate drugs at the same rate that humans eliminate drugs; small mammals usually eliminate drugs faster than large mammals. Since drug elimination is intimately associated with physiologic properties that are well described among species, it seems reasonable to surmise that drug elimination can be scaled among mammals. Analysis of drug pharmacokinetics in numerous species demonstrates that drug elimination among species is predictable and, in general, obeys the power equation Y = aWa. Early papers on interspecies pharmacokinetic scaling normalized the x- and y-axes to illustrate the superimposability of pharmacokinetic curves from different species. More recently, the x- and y-axes have been left in the common units of concentration and time, and individual pharmacokinetic variables have been adjusted to predict pharmacokinetic profiles in an untested species, usually humans.},

While current influenza vaccines offer varying levels of protection, there remains a pressing need for effective antiviral drugs to supplement vaccine efforts. Currently, the FDA-approved antiviral drugs for influenza include oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir marboxil. These antivirals primarily target the virus, making them vulnerable to drug resistance. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir, against probenecid, which targets the host cells and is less likely to engender resistance. Our results show that probenecid has superior antiviral efficacy compared to oseltamivir in both in vitro replication assays and in vivo mouse models of influenza infection.},

  abstract = {Probenecid is a white crystalline solid commonly used as a uricosuric agent in the treatment of gout. Because of its inhibitory effects on renal tubule transport processes, probenecid is also used as a therapeutic adjunct to enhance blood levels of penicillin and its action. Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering probenecid ({$>$}99\% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex once daily, 5 days per week in 14-day, 13-week, and 2-year studies. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Chinese hamster ovary cells. 14-Day Studies: Doses used in the 14-day studies for both rats and mice were 0, 200, 400, 800, 1,600, or 3,200 mg/kg. Of the animals receiving 3,200 mg/kg, all rats, all female mice, and two of five male mice died during the studies. No deaths occurred among the other dose groups. There was a significant reduction in body weight gain in male and female rats receiving 1,600 mg/kg and in female rats receiving 800 mg/kg. No gross lesions were attributed to probenecid administration in rats or mice of either sex. 13-Week Studies: Doses used in the 13-week studies were 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg for rats and 0, 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1,600 mg/kg for mice. No rats died during the 13-week studies. In mice, 5 of 10 males and 3 of 10 females receiving 1,600 mg/kg and 1 of 10 males receiving 800 mg/kg died during the study. Significant reductions in body weight gain occurred in male rats administered 800 mg/kg, male mice administered 1,600 mg/kg, and female mice administered 800 or 1,600 mg/kg. All dose groups of male rats and all groups of female rats receiving 100 mg/kg or more showed significant increases in absolute and/or relative liver weights compared to control groups. This change was also seen in mice receiving 200 mg/kg and greater, except female mice in the 400 mg/kg group. No compound-related lesions occurred in rats or mice of either sex. Based on compound-related deaths and suppression of body weight gains observed at higher doses in the 13-week studies, doses of 0, 100, and 400 mg/kg were used for the 2-year studies in rats and mice. These doses were administered once daily, 5 days a week for up to 103 weeks to groups of 50 males or 50 females of each species. Body Weight and Survival in the 2-Year Studies: The mean body weight of high-dose female rats was 10\% to 20\% lower than that of controls throughout the studies. Mean body weights for all other dosed rats and for all dosed mice were similar to those of controls throughout the 2-year studies. Survival of high-dose male rats and high-dose and low-dose male mice was significantly lower than that of controls. Survival rates after 2 years were: male rats--control, 37/50; 100 mg/kg, 34/50; 400 mg/kg, 22/50; female rats--24/50; 35/50; 19/50; male mice--38/50; 23/50; 24/50; female mice--32/49; 32/49; 32/50. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions in the 2-Year Studies: No chemical-related histopathologic toxic effects or increased incidence of tumors attributable to probenecid were observed in male or female rats receiving probenecid by corn oil gavage for up to 2 years. Mammary gland fibroadenomas and combined thyroid C-cell adenomas or carcinomas exhibited significant negative trends in female rats. These decreased tumor rates were associated with lower body weights. The incidence of adrenal medullary pheochromocytomas was significantly decreased in high-dose male rats. No compound-related increase in nonneoplastic lesions was observed in rats of either sex. No compound-related neoplastic effects were observed in male mice. In high-dose female mice, there were significant increases in the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas (3/48; 2/49; 14/49), but there was no corresponding increase in carcinomas (2/48; 2/49; 3/49). Treatment-related increased incidences of ovarian abscesses in female mice were causally related to Klebsiella species infection rather than directly related to chemical administration. Genetic Toxicology: Probenecid was not mutagenic in Salmonenot mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98 with or without metabolic activation. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, probenecid induced sister chromatid exchanges in the absence, but not in the presence of S9 activation. No induction of chromosomal aberrations was observed with or without S9. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of probenecid for male or female F344/N rats receiving 100 or 400 mg/kg in corn oil. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of probenecid for male B6C3F1 mice given 100 or 400 mg/kg probenecid in corn oil. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of probenecid for female B6C3F1 mice based on an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas.

Antiviral chemotherapeutics that target influenza A virus are available; however, rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains has been reported. Consequently, there is a burgeoning need to identify novel anti-influenza A drugs, particularly those that target host gene products required for virus replication, to reduce the likelihood of drug resistance. In this study, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen was performed to identify host druggable gene targets for anti-influenza A virus therapy. The host organic anion transporter-3 gene (OAT3), a member of the SLC22 family of transporters, was validated as being required to support influenza A virus replication. Probenecid, a prototypical uricosuric agent and chemical inhibitor of organic anion transporters known to target OAT3, was shown to be effective in limiting influenza A virus infection               in vitro               (50\% inhibitory concentration [IC               50               ] of 5.0 {\texttimes} 10               -5               to 5.0 {\texttimes} 10               -4               {$\mu$}M;               P               {$<$} 0.005) and               in vivo               (               P               {$<$} 0.05).

Regular vaccination is the principal strategy for controlling influenza virus, although vaccine efficacy is variable. IAV antiviral drugs are available; however, substantial drug resistance has developed to two of the four currently FDAapproved antiviral drugs. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are being sought to reduce the burden of influenza-related disease. A high-throughput screen using a human kinase inhibitor library was performed targeting an emerging IAV strain (H7N9) in A549 cells. The inhibitor library contained 273 structurally diverse, active cell permeable kinase inhibitors with known bioactivity and safety profiles, many of which are at advanced stages of clinical development. The current study shows that treatment of human A549 cells with kinase inhibitors dinaciclib, flavopiridol, or PIK-75 exhibits potent antiviral activity against H7N9 IAV as well as other IAV strains. Thus, targeting host kinases can provide a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach against IAV. These findings provide a path forward for repurposing existing kinase inhibitors safely as potential antivirals, particularly those that can be tested in vivo and ultimately for clinical use.},

  abstract = {For in vivo studies of influenza dynamics where within-host measurements are fit with a mathematical model, infectivity assays (e.g. 50\% tissue culture infectious dose; TCID50) are often used to estimate the infectious virion concentration over time. Less frequently, measurements of the total (infectious and non-infectious) viral particle concentration (obtained using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; rRT-PCR) have been used as an alternative to infectivity assays. We investigated the degree to which measuring both infectious (via TCID50) and total (via rRT-PCR) viral load allows within-host model parameters to be estimated with greater consistency and reduced uncertainty, compared with fitting to TCID50 data alone. We applied our models to viral load data from an experimental ferret infection study. Best-fit parameter estimates for the ``dual-measurement'' model are similar to those from the TCID50-only model, with greater consistency in best-fit estimates across different experiments, as well as reduced uncertainty in some parameter estimates. Our results also highlight how variation in TCID50 assay sensitivity and calibration may hinder model interpretation, as some parameter estimates systematically vary with known uncontrolled variations in the assay. Our techniques may aid in drawing stronger quantitative inferences from in vivo studies of influenza virus dynamics.},

  abstract = {Oseltamivir is a potent, selective, oral neuraminidase inhibitor for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, are increased in the presence of probenecid, suggesting that the combination could allow for the use of reduced doses of oseltamivir. To investigate this proposal, we developed a population pharmacokinetic model and simulated the pharmacokinetics of candidate combination regimens of oral oseltamivir (45 mg and 30 mg twice a day) plus oral probenecid (500 mg/6 hourly). Probenecid plus oseltamivir 45 mg achieved all the pharmacokinetic parameters expected of oseltamivir alone, but combination with oseltamivir 30 mg and dose interval extension approaches did not. An oseltamivir---probenecid combination may compromise tolerability and enhance the potential for drug interactions. In addition, increased dosing requirements may affect compliance and attainment of optimal oseltamivir exposure, potentially facilitating the emergence of viral strains with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir. These factors, set alongside increased capacity for oseltamivir production, should be carefully considered before an oseltamivir---probenecid combination is used.},

Historical examples include sildenafil citrate transitioning to an erectile dysfunction treatment and thalidomide shifting from a sedative to an immunomodulatory agent. Advocates tout its potential to address unmet medical needs by expediting development, reducing costs, and using drugs with established safety profiles. However, concerns exist regarding specificity for new indications, safety, and regulatory exploitation. Ethical considerations include equitable access, informed consent when using drugs off-label, and transparency. Recent advancements include artificial intelligence (AI) applications, network pharmacology, and omics technologies. Clinical trials explore repurposed drugs' efficacy, with regulatory agencies facilitating approval. Challenges include intellectual property protection, drug target specificity, trial design complexities, and funding limitations. Ethical challenges encompass patient autonomy, potential conflicts of interest due to financial incentives for industries, and resource allocation. Future directions involve precision medicine, AI, and global collaboration. In conclusion, drug repurposing offers a promising pathway for therapeutic innovation but requires careful consideration of its complexities and ethical implications to maximize benefits and minimize risks.},

The NCI-H441 cell line cultured at the air-liquid interface mimics certain phenotypic and functional characteristics of the human alveolar epithelium. Here the permeability properties of the NCI-H441 model were characterised and compared against published data using experimental measurements and mathematical modelling. Cells were cultured under air-liquid interface conditions and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and apparent permeability (Papp) to sodium fluorescein (MW 383 Da) and fluorescently labelled dextrans (MW 4000--150,000 Da) was measured. It was found that TEER was independent of cell seeding density while Papp decreased with higher seeding density and plateaued beyond a density of 500,000 cells/cm2. Using the framework of functional pore analysis, a mathematical model was fitted to Papp values measured in this work as well as previously published datasets from human cell lines and primary human and rat cells. It was found that the air-liquid interface NCI-H441 model most closely matched the primary cell line results in contrast to published data using A549 and liquid-interface NCI-H441 cell cultures, supporting the use of this model to study the permeability of the alveolar epithelium to large molecules.},

It is a potent growth factor for the use in the cervical spine surgery (FDA approved 2002) and has been marketed as ``Infuse'' for treating open tibial shaft fractures (FDA approved 2004). However, its use is limited by several significant side effects that maybe due to its potency and effect on different stem cell populations in the spine. BMP2 is expressed throughout the human body in several tissues and at a very high concentration in the blood. BMP receptors, especially BMP receptor type Ia, is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. Currently, it is difficult to determine how BMP2 is physiologically distributed in mice or humans and no quantitative models are available. A Physiologically-Based Pharmaco-Kinetic (PBPK) model has been developed to determine steady-state distribution of BMP2 in mice. The multi-compartmental PBPK model represents relevant organ/tissues with physiological accuracy. The organs/tissue compartments chosen were brain, lung, heart, liver, pancreas, kidney, uterus, bone and fat. A blood compartment maintained connectivity among the various organs. Four processes characterized the change in the concentration of the protein in every compartment: blood flow in, blood flow out, protein turnover and receptor binding in the organ. The unique aspects of the model are the determination of elimination using receptor kinetics and generation using protein turnover. The model also predicts steady state concentrations of BMP2 in tissues in mice and may be used for possible scale-up of dosage regimens in humans.},

  abstract = {Scaling approaches are used to describe or predict clearance for paediatric or obese populations from normal-weight adult values. Theoretical allometry assumes the existence of a universal bodyweight-based scaling relationship. Although theoretical allometry is highly disputed, it is commonly applied in pharmacological data analyses and clinical practice. The aim of the current review is to (1) increase pharmacologists' understanding of theoretical allometry to better understand the (implicit) assumptions and (dis)advantages and (2) highlight important methodological considerations with the application of this methodology. Theoretical allometry originated in an empirical, and later debated, observation by Kleiber of a scaling exponent of 0.75 between basal metabolic rate and body mass of mammals. The mathematical framework of West, Brown, and Enquist provides one possible explanation for this value. To date, multiple key assumptions of this framework have been disputed or disproven, and an increasing body of evidence is emerging against the existence of one universal allometric exponent. The promise of ease and universality of use that comes with theoretical approaches may be the reason they are so strongly sought after and defended. However, ecologists have suggested that the theory should move from a `Newtonian approach', in which physical explanations are sought for a universal law and variability is of minor importance, to a `Darwinian approach', in which variability is considered of primary importance for which evolutionary explanations can be found. No scientific support was found for the application of allometry for within-species scaling, so the application of basal metabolic rate-based scaling principles to clearance scaling remains unsubstantiated. Recent insights from physiologically based modelling approaches emphasise the interplay between drugs with different properties and physiological variables that underlie drug clearance, which drives the variability in the allometric scaling exponent in the field of pharmacology. To deal with this variability, drug-specific or patient-specific adaptations to theoretical allometric scaling are proposed, that introduce empiric elements and reduce the universality of the theory. The use of allometric scaling with an exponent of 0.75 may hold empirical merit for paediatric populations, except for the youngest individuals (aged {$\leq$} 5 years). Nevertheless, biological interpretations and extrapolation potential attributed to models based on 0.75 allometric scaling are theoretically unfounded, and merits of the empirical application of this function should, as for all models, always be supported by appropriate model validation procedures. In this respect, it is not the value of the allometric exponent but the description and prediction of individual clearance values and drug concentrations that are of primary interest.},

The AUC/dose ratio increased with the dose, indicating nonlinear elimination. The total body clearance declined from 64.5 ml/min for 250 mg to 26.0 ml/min for 1,500 mg. The renal clearance of probenecid remained constant, 0.6--0.8 ml/min. Protein binding of probenecid is high (91\%) and independent of the dose. The phase I metabolites show lower protein binding values (34--59\%). The protein binding of probenecid glucuronidein vitro (spiked plasma) is 75\%. Probenecid is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 to three phase I metabolites. Each of the metabolites accounts for less than 10\% of the dose administered; the percentage recovered in the urine is independent of the dose. The main metabolite probenecid glucuronide is only present in urine and not in plasma. The renal excretion rate-time profile of probenecid glucuronide shows a plateau value of approximately 700{$\mu$}g/min (46 mg/h) with acidic urine pH. The duration of this plateau value depends on the dose: 2 h at 500 mg, 10 h at 1,000 mg and 20 h at 1,500 mg. It is demonstrated that probenecid glucuronide must be formed in the kidney during its passage of the tubule.

Doses of up to 675 mg were well-tolerated. The pharmacokinetics were dose linear. Oseltamivir phosphate (OS) was rapidly and completely absorbed and converted (median conversion level, 93\%) to the active carboxylate metabolite. Median elimination half-lives (and 95\% confidence intervals [CI]) were 1.0 h (0.9 to 1.1 h) for OS and 5.1 h (4.7 to 5.7 h) for oseltamivir carboxylate (OC). One subject repeatedly showed markedly reduced OS-to-OC conversion, indicating constitutionally impaired carboxylesterase activity. The coadministration of probenecid resulted in a mean contraction in the apparent volume of distribution of OC of 40\% (95\% CI, 37 to 44\%) and a reduction in the renal elimination of OC of 61\% (95\% CI, 58 to 62\%), thereby increasing the median area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for OC by 154\% (range, 71 to 278\%). The AUC increase for OC in saliva was approximately three times less than the AUC increase for OC in plasma. A loading dose 1.25 times the maintenance dose should be given for severe influenza pneumonia. Probenecid coadministration may allow considerable dose saving for oseltamivir, but more information on OC penetration into respiratory secretions is needed to devise appropriate dose regimens.},

  abstract = {The importance of size as a determinant of metabolic rate (MR) was first suggested by Sarrus and Rameaux over 160 years ago. Max Rubner's finding of a proportionality between MR and body surface area in dogs (in 1883) was consistent with Sarrus and Rameaux's formulation and suggested a proportionality between MR and body mass (Mb) raised to the power of 2/3. However, interspecific analyses compiled during the first half of the 20th century concluded that mammalian basal MR (BMR, ml O2 h-1) was proportional to Mb3/4, a viewpoint that persisted for seven decades, even leading to its common application to non-mammalian groups. Beginning in 1997, the field was re-invigorated by three new theoretical explanations for 3/4-power BMR scaling. However, the debate over which theory accurately explains 3/4-power scaling may be premature, because some authors maintain that there is insufficient evidence to adopt an exponent of 3/4 over 2/3. If progress toward understanding the non-isometric scaling of BMR is ever to be made, it is first essential to know what the relationship actually is. We re-examine previous investigations of BMR scaling by standardising units and recalculating regression statistics. The proportion of large herbivores in a data set is positively correlated both with the scaling exponent(b, where BMR=aMbb) and the coefficient of variation (CV: the standard deviation of ln-ln residuals) of the relationship. Inclusion of large herbivores therefore both inflates b and increases variation around the calculated trendline. This is related to the long fast duration required to achieve the postabsorptive conditions required for determination of BMR, and because peak post-feeding resting MR (RMRpp) scales with an exponent of 0.75{\textpm}0.03 (95\%CI). Large herbivores are therefore less likely to be postabsorptive when MR is measured, and are likely to have a relatively high MR if not postabsorptive.The 3/4 power scaling of RMRpp is part of a wider trend where,with the notable exception of cold-induced maximum MR(b=0.65{\textpm}0.05), b is positively correlated with the elevation of the relationship (higher MR values scale more steeply). Thus exercise-induced maximum MR (b=0.87{\textpm}0.05) scales more steeply than RMRpp, field MR (b=0.73{\textpm}0.04), thermoneutral resting MR (RMRt, b=0.712{\textpm}0.013) and BMR. The implication of this observation is that contamination of BMR data with non-basal measurements is likely to increase the BMR scaling exponent even if the contamination is randomly distributed with respect to Mb. Artificially elevated scaling exponents can therefore be accounted for by the inclusion of measurements that fail to satisfy the requirements for basal metabolism, which are strictly defined (adult,non-reproductive, postabsorptive animals resting in a thermoneutral environment during the inactive circadian phase). Similarly, a positive correlation between Mb and body temperature(Tb) and between Tb and mass-independent BMR contributes to elevation of b. While not strictly a defined condition for the measurement of BMR, the normalisation of BMR measurements to a common Tb (36.2{$^\circ$}C) to achieve standard metabolic rate (SMR) further reduces the CV of the relationship. Clearly the value of the exponent depends on the conditions under which the data are selected. The exponent for true BMR is 0.686 ({\textpm}0.014), Tb normalised SMR is 0.675 ({\textpm}0.013) and RMRt is 0.712 ({\textpm}0.013).},

  abstract = {Existing pharmacodynamic (PD) mathematical models for drug combina\- tions discriminate antagonistic, additive, multiplicative, and synergistic effects, but fail to consider how concentration-dependent drug interaction effects may vary across an entire dose-response matrix. We developed a two-way pharmacodynamic (TWPD) model to capture the PD of two-drug combinations. TWPD captures interactions between upstream and downstream drugs that act on different stages of viral replication, by quantifying upstream drug efficacy and concentration-dependent effects on down\- stream drug pharmacodynamic parameters. We applied TWPD to previously published in vitro drug matrixes for repurposed potential anti-Ebola and anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug pairs. Depending on the drug pairing, the model recapitulated combined efficacies as or more accurately than existing models and can be used to infer efficacy at untested drug concentrations. TWPD fits the data slightly better in one direction for all drug pairs, meaning that we can tentatively infer the upstream drug. Based on its high accuracy, TWPD could be used in concert with PK models to estimate the therapeutic effects of drug pairs in vivo.},
