# Overview

This supplement file describes how to use the data and code to reproduce all findings.
It also contains additional results.



# Code and file information

All code and data needed to reproduce the results are provided as supplement.

The data in a format that is ready for modeling is located in the `data ` folder. 

Scripts to fit the model to the data and run the simulations for different doses are located in the `analysis-code` folder. Code to generate figures and tables is located in the `plotting-code` folder.

# Additional results

The following sections provide additional results from the model fitting and simulations.

## Table of parameter estimates

Estimates for parameter values that are fit to the model are provided in table @tbl-parametertab .


```{r}
#| label: tbl-parametertab
#| tbl-cap: "Another fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable1 = readRDS(here("results", "tables", "parametertab1.rds"))
resulttable1
```


Values for fixed parameters are described in the methods section of the main text.

Additional tables of best fit estimates for all fixed parameter samples can be generated with the supplied code.

## Predicted versus observed plot

Figure @fig-predobs shows the (unweighted) predicted versus observed results for each fitted variable.

## Residual plots

Figures @fig-residual1 and @fig-residual2 show the weighted residual plots for the best fit model, one separated for each variable, and one combined.

## Time-series for delayed treatment regimens


@fig-result-tx2 shows time-series for all model variables for 1, 10 and 100mg/kg doses with treatment starting 2 days post infection. @fig-result-tx3 shows the same for treatment starting 3 days post infection.

## Time-series for reduced treatment regimens


@fig-result-tx4 shows time-series for all model variables for 1, 10 and 100mg/kg doses with daily (instead of twice daily) treatment starting on day 1 post infection. @fig-result-tx5 shows the same for a single treatment on day 1 post infection.
